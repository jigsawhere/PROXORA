Deep within the colossal structure, the air grew heavy with the dust of ages and the faint scent of ozone. The glowing patterns on the walls intensified, revealing themselves to be not mere decorations, but intricate historical records, projected holographically by an unseen power source. Aris and Lena, with Kenji’s linguistic insights and Jax’s technical prowess, began to piece together the story of the beings who had built this world. They were the Lumina, a civilization of light-sensitive beings who had mastered stellar engineering. Their sun, a red dwarf, was dying, accelerating its collapse in a way they couldn't prevent.

The projections showed their desperate attempts to stabilize their star, then their heartbreaking decision to send out a final, desperate signal, a plea for any intelligent life to learn from their mistakes and perhaps, carry on their legacy. They had poured their entire history, their scientific knowledge, and their philosophical wisdom into the signal, hoping it would reach someone before their world was consumed. The final images were poignant: the Lumina, gathered in their grand structures, accepting their fate with a quiet dignity as their sun swelled, turning their crimson world into a fiery tomb. The warning wasn't just about a collapsing star; it was about the fragility of existence, the responsibility that came with advanced knowledge, and the profound loneliness of a universe where even the most brilliant civilizations could vanish without a trace. The crew stood in silence, humbled by the echoes of a dying race, burdened by the weight of their final message.
