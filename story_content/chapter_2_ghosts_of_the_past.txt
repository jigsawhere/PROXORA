The old house stood silent, a skeletal hand reaching for the bruised twilight sky. Elara pushed through the overgrown gate, the rusty hinges groaning a mournful welcome. Dust motes danced in the slivers of light piercing the grimy windows, illuminating a scene frozen in time. A child’s wooden horse lay overturned in the hallway, its painted eyes staring blankly at the ceiling. A half-finished embroidery project rested on a faded armchair, the needle still threaded, as if its owner had just stepped away for a moment.

A chill, not entirely from the evening air, prickled Elara’s skin. This wasn't just an abandoned house; it was a tomb of memories, each object whispering tales of lives abruptly halted. She ran a hand over a dusty piano, its keys yellowed and silent. A faint, sweet melody seemed to echo in the air, a phantom tune from a forgotten past. It was the same melody that had haunted her dreams since she arrived in Fern Hollow, a melody she couldn't place, yet felt deeply in her bones.

In the parlor, a large, ornate mirror hung crookedly, reflecting a distorted image of the room. As Elara approached, a flicker of movement caught her eye. For a fleeting second, a child's face, pale and indistinct, seemed to peer back from the depths of the glass, its eyes wide with an unspoken sorrow. Elara gasped, stepping back, her heart hammering against her ribs. The reflection shimmered, then settled, showing only the empty, decaying room. Was it a trick of the light, or had the ghosts of Fern Hollow truly begun to stir? The air grew heavy, thick with unspoken grief, and Elara knew, with a chilling certainty, that she was not alone in this house of echoes.
