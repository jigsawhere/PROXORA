After what felt like an eternity, the 'Stardust' finally broke through Kepler-186f's upper atmosphere. The view from the observation deck was breathtaking and unsettling. The planet was a canvas of deep reds and oranges, bathed in the perpetual twilight of its red dwarf sun. Colossal, angular structures, unlike anything human architects could conceive, pierced the crimson sky, stretching for miles across the desolate landscape. They were ancient, weathered by eons of alien winds, yet their sheer scale spoke of a civilization that once commanded immense power.

Captain Rostova skillfully guided the 'Stardust' towards the coordinates embedded in the alien signal, a vast, circular clearing surrounded by towering, crystalline spires. The landing was smooth, but the silence that followed was deafening, broken only by the hum of the ship's life support. Aris, Lena, Kenji, and Jax disembarked, their boots crunching on the reddish dust. The air was thin, metallic, but breathable. As they approached the nearest structure, a sense of profound history washed over them. The walls were etched with intricate, glowing patterns, pulsating with a faint, internal light. Kenji, ever the scientist, immediately began scanning the alien flora, which seemed to thrive on the strange, mineral-rich soil. Jax, meanwhile, detected faint energy signatures emanating from within the structure. This wasn't just a ruin; it was a tomb, a monument, and perhaps, a final message from a civilization that had vanished long ago. The answers they sought were within reach, but the crimson world held its secrets close.
