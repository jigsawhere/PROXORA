The signal from Kepler-186f consumed Aris. Sleep became a luxury, food an afterthought. His small apartment, usually a sanctuary of quiet contemplation, transformed into a chaotic war room, littered with printouts, holographic projections, and discarded coffee cups. Lena, initially skeptical, had become his most ardent supporter, her sharp mind a perfect foil to his intuitive leaps. Together, they delved into the alien cipher, a tapestry of mathematical sequences and resonant frequencies that defied conventional decryption methods. It wasn't a language in the human sense, but a complex data stream, layered with intricate patterns.

Days bled into nights. They tried every known algorithm, every theoretical framework, but the signal remained stubbornly opaque. Then, a breakthrough. Aris, in a moment of frustrated inspiration, fed the raw data into an ancient, experimental quantum entanglement processor he had salvaged from a defunct research project. The machine whirred to life, its crystalline core glowing with an ethereal light. On the main screen, a new pattern emerged, not a linguistic one, but a spatial map. Coordinates. Precise, three-dimensional coordinates pointing directly to Kepler-186f, but not just the planet itself â€“ a specific location on its surface. And then, the warning. A series of rapid, discordant pulses, overlaid with a faint, almost subliminal image: a dying star, collapsing into itself, and a fleeting glimpse of a fleeing civilization. The message wasn't just an invitation; it was a desperate plea, a race against an impending cosmic catastrophe. The weight of their discovery grew heavier, the stakes immeasurably higher.
