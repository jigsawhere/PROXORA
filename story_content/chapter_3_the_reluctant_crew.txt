The revelation of the alien warning sent shockwaves through the scientific community, then the global governments. A dying civilization, a collapsing star, and a desperate plea for help â€“ it was too monumental to ignore. Yet, the sheer scale of the undertaking, an interstellar journey to a distant exoplanet, was met with a mixture of awe and trepidation. Resources were scarce, and the political climate was fraught. Aris, now a reluctant hero, found himself thrust into the spotlight, tasked with assembling a crew for humanity's first true interstellar voyage.

His first choice was Lena, whose sharp intellect and unwavering support had been invaluable. She agreed without hesitation, her scientific curiosity outweighing any fear. Next was Captain Eva Rostova, a grizzled veteran of deep-space mining operations, whose cynicism was as legendary as her piloting skills. She scoffed at the "alien fairy tales" but couldn't resist the challenge of piloting the 'Stardust', humanity's fastest, most experimental vessel. Dr. Kenji Tanaka, a xenobotanist with an encyclopedic knowledge of exoplanetary ecosystems, joined with quiet enthusiasm, eager to study life beyond Earth. Finally, Jax, a former black-market tech specialist with a knack for improvisation and a questionable past, was brought in for his unparalleled ability to fix anything with wires and a prayer. Each member was a specialist, a maverick in their own right, united by a shared, albeit often unspoken, sense of duty. The 'Stardust' stood ready, a gleaming spear pointed at the heart of the unknown, carrying humanity's hopes and fears into the vast, indifferent cosmos.
